# Automated Backup System

## Overview
This project provides an automated backup solution for critical directories using a shell script. It ensures data integrity and availability by creating daily backups and rotating them based on your specified retention policy.

## Features
- **Automated Backups**: The shell script automatically backs up specified directories to an external drive.
- **Retention Policy**: Backups are categorized as daily, weekly, and monthly, with a specified retention count for each category.
- **Cron Job**: Scheduled tasks ensure backups run without manual intervention.
- **Notifications**: Successful backups trigger a cURL request to a specified endpoint (Webhook).

## Prerequisites
